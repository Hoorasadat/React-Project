            As a highly organized and detail-oriented full-stack software developer, I bring a strong problem-solving mindset to every project. With a background in Object-Oriented Software Development and Full-Stack Software Development programs at SAIT, I have honed my skills in web application development. Additionally, my hands-on experience in full-stack software development and business analysis within the oil & gas industry has provided me with a unique perspective on delivering robust solutions.
            <br />
            I am well-versed in agile Scrum methodology and committed to practicing unit testing and quality assurance, all while prioritizing a superior user experience and seamless system integration. My ability to quickly grasp new concepts allows me to continually enhance deliverable quality and reduce costs through improved efficiency and heightened productivity.
